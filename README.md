# SplineCatmullRom
The initial function is Spline(points without format, number of points between two points)
For example 
var vert = [
             0.0,  1.0,  0.0,
             1.0, 1.0,  0.0,
             0.0, 1.0,  1.0
        ];
vert= Spline(vert, 10);
And the result will be aproximately 30 points that form a spline.
